Description: Easy implementation of the MABAC multi-criteria decision method, that was introduced by Pamučar and Ćirović in the work entitled: “The selection of transport and handling resources in logistics centers using Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC) - <doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2014.11.057> - which aimed to choose implements for logistics centers. This package receives data, preferably in a spreadsheet, reads it and applies the mathematical algorithms inherent to the MABAC method to generate a ranking with the optimal solution according to the established criteria, weights and type of criteria. The data will be normalized, weighted by the weights, the border area will be determined, the distances to this border area will be calculated and finally a ranking with the optimal option will be generated.
